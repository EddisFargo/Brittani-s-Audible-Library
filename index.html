R. Martin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eugenides, the queen's thief, can steal anything - or so he says. When his boasting lands him in prison and the king's magus invites him on a quest to steal a legendary object, he's in no position to refuse. The magus thinks he has the right tool for the job, but Gen has plans of his own.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Queen's Thief novels have been praised by writers, critics, reviewers, and fans, and have been honored with glowing reviews, \"best of\" citations, and numerous awards, including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, a Newbery Honor, the Andre Norton Award shortlist, and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Newbery Honor Book</p> <p>An ALA Notable Book</p> <p>A YALSA Best Book for Young Adults</p> <p>A Horn Book Fanfare Book</p> <p>A New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age</p> <p>A Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books&nbsp;</p> <p>Blue Ribbon Book</p> <p>A Junior Library Guild Selection</p> <p>“The Queen’s Thief books awe and inspire me. They have the feel of a secret, discovered history of real but forgotten lands. The plot-craft is peerless, the revelations stunning, and the characters flawed, cunning, heartbreaking, exceptional. Megan Whalen Turner’s books have a permanent spot on my favorites shelf, with space waiting for more books to come.” (Laini Taylor, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of the Daughter of Smoke and Bone novels and Strange the Dreamer)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Unforgettable characters, plot twists that will make your head spin, a world rendered in elegant detail - you will fall in love with every page of these stories.

Thrust among those who see her as a symbol of a monstrous kingdom, she barely knows who she is without the veil of the Maiden. But what she does know is that nothing is as dangerous to her as him. The Dark One. The Prince of Atlantia. He wants her to fight him, and that’s one order she’s more than happy to obey. He may have taken her, but he will never have her.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Choice...</b></p> <p>Casteel Da’Neer is known by many names and many faces. His lies are as seductive as his touch.

But he’s the only way for her to get what she wants - to find her brother Ian and see for herself if he has become a soulless Ascended. Working with Casteel instead of against him presents its own risks. He still tempts her with every breath, offering up all she’s ever wanted. Casteel has plans for her. Ones that could expose her to unimaginable pleasure and unfathomable pain. Plans that will force her to look beyond everything she thought she knew about herself - about him. Plans that could bind their lives together in unexpected ways that neither kingdom is prepared for. And she’s far too reckless, too hungry, to resist the temptation.</p> <p><b>A Secret...</b></p> <p>But unrest has grown in Atlantia as they await the return of their Prince.

And as her abilities to feel pain and emotion begin to grow and strengthen, the Atlantians start to fear her. Dark secrets are at play, ones steeped in the blood-drenched sins of two kingdoms that would do anything to keep the truth hidden. But when the earth begins to shake, and the skies start to bleed, it may already be too late.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-11-03","publishers":[{"name":"Brilliance Audio"}],"length":"24h 21m ","categories":[{"name":"Romance","url":"18580518011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580523011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/013026/bk_brll_013026_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"610nCuFtBzL","asin":"1488206570","subHeading":"The Harbinger Series, Book 1","title":"Storm and Fury","authors":"Jennifer L.

And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac's true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book - because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds.</p>","releaseDate":"2008-06-06","publishers":[{"name":"Brilliance Audio"}],"length":"8h 57m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Horror","url":"18574490011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/000315/bk_brll_000315_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"614kLJh4vTL","asin":"B009SDRHZQ","subHeading":"A Dani O' Malley Novel, Book 1","title":"Iced","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante, Natalie Ross","length":"14 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51ioycYhhPL","asin":"B00REUDNMG","title":"Burned","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante, Natalie Ross","length":"13 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51Ak6kTb9GL","asin":"B01AILNJZS","subHeading":"Fever Series, Book 8","title":"Feverborn","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Luke Daniels, Jill Redfield","length":"12 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51BH7XETIrL","asin":"B01N1X5NBD","title":"Feversong","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Jim Frangione, Amanda Leigh Cobb","length":"16 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"61KeT3KClZL","asin":"B078Z29HRV","subHeading":"Fever, Book 10","title":"High Voltage","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Amanda Leigh Cobb, Jim Frangione","length":"13 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51-zb6HV7+L","asin":"B002VA3FS6","subHeading":"Highlander, Book 6","title":"The Immortal Highlander","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"614vGkU2fmL","asin":"151137358X","subHeading":"Fever, Book 11","title":"Kingdom of Shadow and Light","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Amanda Leigh Cobb, Aiden Snow","length":"15 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51gNyz6IDgL","asin":"B002V5D0LI","subHeading":"Highlander, Book 1","title":"Beyond the Highland Mist","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"61ZZyFEun2L","asin":"B007TKHTFS","title":"Into the Dreaming","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"3 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51caOI4qy9L","asin":"B002V8KLEO","subHeading":"The Highlander Series, Book 7","title":"Spell of the Highlander","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51Sw2oWeKFL","asin":"B002V5GNTY","subHeading":"The Highlander Series, Book 5","title":"The Dark Highlander","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"515WOhrVJhL","asin":"B002V0Q4KW","subHeading":"Highlander, Book 4","title":"Kiss of the Highlander","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"11 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51MrfJ+oRPL","asin":"B002V5BHKY","subHeading":"Highlander, Book 3","title":"The Highlander's Touch","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51UQPkPby+L","asin":"B002V1PQPA","subHeading":"Highlander, Book 2","title":"To Tame a Highland Warrior","authors":"Karen Marie Moning","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"10 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51kiH4wotnL","asin":"B002VA9GXE","subHeading":"The Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1","title":"Dark Lover","authors":"J.

But Meg knows the dangers, for she has seen in the cards how it will all end: with her standing beside a grave. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-03-07","publishers":[{"name":"Penguin Audio"}],"length":"16h 21m ","categories":[{"name":"Romance","url":"18580518011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580523011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/002993/bk_peng_002993_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61LxDcqNdzL","asin":"B075FCS4W7","title":"Lake Silence","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","length":"13 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"51Co290ypUL","asin":"1984847090","subHeading":"The World of the Others, Book 2","title":"Wild Country","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","length":"17 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51a9Q3jgNdL","asin":"B003C28KXM","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 1","title":"Daughter of the Blood","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"16 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51osFvwwzeL","asin":"B003LMNK2E","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 2","title":"Heir to the Shadows","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"18 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51b0IWE+jqL","asin":"B003RCE1JY","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 3","title":"Queen of the Darkness","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"17 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51MdgLnqSAL","asin":"B0047AAR02","title":"Dreams Made Flesh","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"16 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"51UYUBGY0rL","asin":"B002V1BNO8","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"Tangled Webs","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"10 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"51FDK8FxIVL","asin":"B002V0KLAG","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"The Invisible Ring","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"13 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51YI+0ECXhL","asin":"B0037M7YN4","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"Shalador's Lady","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"17 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51DgV3Dn5WL","asin":"B002V1A2WW","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"The Shadow Queen","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51ZVcKnUz7L","asin":"0593165586","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 10","title":"The Queen's Bargain","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Gary Littman","length":"14 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"510d7zQNDhL","asin":"B002V8LMBA","subHeading":"Ephemera, Book 1","title":"Sebastian","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Holter Graham","length":"13 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"71bo-V56yIL","asin":"B004NFB84U","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Book","title":"Twilight's Dawn","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"John Sharian","length":"16 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51a-B6knSuL","asin":"B003RCAJ2W","subHeading":"Tir Alainn Trilogy, Book 1","title":"The Pillars of the World","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Erik Synnestvedt","length":"14 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51Wwl1GsG3L","asin":"B00ISAC8XG","title":"Clean Sweep","authors":"Ilona Andrews","narrators":"Renee Raudman","length":"7 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51S7ma86LoL","asin":"B002V8OHEO","subHeading":"Ephemera , Book 2","title":"Belladonna","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Maggie Hoffman","length":"13 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"61VWWZnJaDL","asin":"0062878387","subHeading":"A Hidden Legacy Novel","title":"Emerald Blaze","authors":"Ilona Andrews","narrators":"Emily Rankin","length":"12 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51oEcLTPD0L","asin":"0593347188","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 11","title":"The Queen's Weapons","authors":"Anne Bishop","narrators":"Gary Littman","length":"19 hrs and 48 mins"}],"added":143},{"asin":"B01AIVUX4S","cover":"61K5CDI46-L","title":"Marked in Flesh: A Novel of the Others, Book 4","authors":[{"name":"Anne Bishop","url":"B001IGV1EO"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Alexandra Harris"}],"series":[{"name":"The Others (Bishop)","asin":"B00IIWA44O","bookNumbers":["4"]}],"blurb":"Since the Others allied themselves with the cassandra sangue, the delicate dynamic between humans and Others changed....","downloaded":true,"progress":"Finished","titleShort":"Marked in Flesh","ratings":2759,"rating":4.7,"summary":"<p><i>Fourth in the \"flawless\" (<i>The Reading Café</i>) </i>New York Times<i> best-selling series from the author of </i>Vision in Silver. </p> <p><b>For centuries, the Others and humans have lived side by side in uneasy peace.

One where creatures like Nemesis will be given worth and recognition, where science and information can be shared with everyone and not just the elite. </p> <p>But having power isn't the same thing as keeping it, and change isn't always welcome. The ruling class, the Grandiloquy, has held control over planets and systems for centuries - and they are plotting to stop this teenage Emperor and Nemesis, who is considered nothing more than a creature and certainly not worthy of being Empress. </p> <p>Nemesis will protect Tyrus at any cost. He is the love of her life, and they are partners in this new beginning. But she cannot protect him by being the killing machine she once was. She will have to prove the humanity that she's found inside herself to the whole Empire - or she and Tyrus may lose more than just the throne. But if proving her humanity means that she and Tyrus must do inhuman things, is the fight worth the cost of winning it? </p>","releaseDate":"2017-10-31","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"11h 8m ","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/008016/bk_sans_008016_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61H+3GttiiL","asin":"B008G3SDOS","title":"Insignia","authors":"S.

Then it’s time for the tales to begin....</p> <p>You’ll laugh along to \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" as you listen to the havoc wreaked by a father’s impish gift to his son, read by Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" will take you on a quest through an enchanted garden, alongside three witches and a luckless knight, read by Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>In \"The Warlock’s Hairy Heart\", you’ll be warned about a young warlock who is fearful of love and turns to dark magic to avoid it at all costs, read by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>The calamitous meeting of a foolish king, a cunning charlatan and a mischievous washerwoman unravels in \"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\", read by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley - Harry Potter).</p> <p>And finally, the most iconic of Beedle’s stories. \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" - with its message of humility and wisdom - will introduce you, dear listener, to the Deathly Hallows, read by Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger - <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>, London’s West End and New York’s Broadway).</p> <p>Each of the tales is accompanied by wise and whimsical notes from a certain Albus Dumbledore, surely everyone’s favourite headmaster, read by Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore - Fantastic Beasts films).</p> <p>We’re told these five fables have been firm favourites in wizarding households for centuries, and now it’s your turn to experience these tales from the Wizarding World, as you’ve never heard them before.</p> <p><i>At least 90 percent of the proceeds* received by Pottermore Limited from this audiobook will be made available by the publisher to The Lumos Foundation for their work to help children worldwide out of institutions, so they can thrive in loving families and communities. The Lumos Foundation is a charity registered in England and Wales with registered charity number 1112575.</i></p> <p>Around the world, more than eight million children live in orphanages and other institutions. What may be surprising is that about 80 percent of them aren’t actually orphans. They have family who could care for them, with the right support. Lumos is an international children’s charity founded by J.K. Rowling. Named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, Lumos’ mission is to ensure that by 2050 all children will grow up in loving, protective families.</p> <p>*Proceeds means the cash-price or cash-equivalent price less sales taxes and reasonable expenses.&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-03-31","publishers":[{"name":"Pottermore Publishing"}],"categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths","url":"18572258011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/potr/000526/bk_potr_000526_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61HxW4sQfZL","asin":"B01N4S7VVP","subHeading":"Read by Eddie Redmayne","title":"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them","authors":"J.K.

When she has a hunch about an ongoing murder investigation, she knows it could be her only chance to prove herself and truly break into the “boys' club” of Dublin’s police force.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Carrie uncovers this make-or-break moment in a case file that her sister Aifric, a newly qualified barrister, leaves on their kitchen counter: Robert Collins has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend after a fight in a local pub.

All the while, Carrie is very aware that she’s crossed the line—if the detective sergeant running the investigation finds out she’s been messing around with his case, her career will be over before it has begun.

It’s a job she’s uniquely suited for, thanks to the secret talent that gives her an uncanny edge - Charlie can see dead people, whose tormented spirits cry out to her for the justice only she can provide.

Now the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author launches a red-hot new paranormal romantic thriller series featuring the fascinating Dr. Charlotte Stone, a serial killer expert whose extraordinary powers lead her from ecstasy to terror. </p> <p> Dr. Charlotte Stone sees what others do not. A sought-after expert in criminal pathology, Charlie regularly sits face-to-face with madmen. Obsessed with learning what makes human monsters commit terrible crimes, Charlie desires little else from life - no doubt because when she was 16, she herself survived a serial killer's bloodbath: A man butchered the family of Charlie's best friend, Holly, then left the girl's body on a seaside boardwalk one week later. </p> <p> Because of the information Charlie gave police, the Boardwalk Killer went underground. She kept to herself her eerie postmortem visions of Holly and her mother. And even years later, knowing her contact with ghosts might undermine her credibility as a psychological expert, Charlie tells no one about the visits she gets from the spirit world. </p> <p>Now all-too-handsome FBI agent Tony Bartoli is telling Charlie that a teenage girl is missing, her family slaughtered. Bartoli suspects that after 15 years, the Boardwalk Killer - or a sick copycat with his M.O. - is back. Time is running short for an innocent, kidnapped girl, and Bartoli pleads for Charlie's help. </p> <p>This is the one case Charlie shouldn't go near. But she also knows that she may be the one person in the world who can stop this vicious killer. For Charlie - whose good looks disguise a world of hurt, vulnerability, and potent psychic gifts - a frantic hunt for a madman soon becomes a complex test of cunning, passions, and secrets. Aiding Dr. Stone on her quest to catch a madman is a ghostly presence with bad intentions: the fiery spirit of seductive bad boy Michael Garland who refuses to be ignored, though in his cat and mouse game they may both lose their hearts. </p> <p>Dr. Charlotte Stone sees what others do not.

Steve Maharidge never talked about “the good war.” On the surface, the Maharidges were a normal working-class family in the suburbs of Cleveland. But behind closed doors, even the most mundane moments could trigger Steve’s violent, traumatic episodes, which left his son Dale searching for clues to his past. And yet, there was only one: a black-and-white photograph of Steve with another soldier that hung permanently on the wall in the basement.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Dead Drink First</i>, Dale Maharidge, now a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, recounts his 18-year quest to learn everything he could about the man in the photo with the hopes of discovering a side of his late father he never knew. The result was something Dale never expected: Not only would he learn the man’s name - Herman Walter Mulligan - but he would help locate his remains and ultimately bring him home 74 years after he was killed in action.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this deeply personal audio documentary, Dale retraces his journey through never-before-heard conversations with WWII veterans, their children, and the team of strangers that assembled to find Mulligan and bury him on American soil. In an epic search for a lost Marine, Dale finds forgiveness, lifelong friendships, and uncovers the rich, uniquely American truth about how and why we repatriate our fallen soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note: </b>This story features explicit language and references to domestic abuse, violence, and war that may be upsetting to some listeners.

Belittled by his pompous uncle and sniveling aunt (not to mention his absolute terror of a cousin, Dudley), Harry has resigned himself to a mediocre existence in the cupboard under the stairs. But then the letters start dropping on the doormat at Number Four, Privet Drive. Addressed to “Mr. H. Potter” and stamped shut with a purple wax seal, the peculiar envelopes are swiftly confiscated by his relentlessly cruel family. But nothing stops Rubeus Hagrid, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man, from kicking down the door and bursting in with astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard - and not only a wizard, he’s an incredibly famous wizard. Hagrid spirits him away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, setting into motion an incredible adventure (Banks run by goblins! Enchanted train platforms! Invisibility Cloaks!) that listeners won’t ever forget.</p> <p>Having now become classics of our time, the Harry Potter audiobooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism to listeners of all ages. With its message of hope, belonging, and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new listeners.&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2015-11-20","publishers":[{"name":"Pottermore Publishing"}],"length":"8h 18m ","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18572491011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/potr/000001/bk_potr_000001_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51XllRwv1SL","asin":"0061999881","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia Adult Box Set","authors":"C.
